Servo control:
 * In first use of a pololu, it must be connected to a GUI computer via USB and configured using the software pololu supplies. The configuration should be to use USB interface (the "chained" one) other than the RS232.
 * install kernel-module-cdc-acm - no need in ubuntu.
 * to get default permission, the user should be added to the group 'dialout' - edit /etc/groups

Wireless:
 * install the rt3070 and rt3070-firmeare from opkg
 * To configure the ad-hoc thing use the "sys-files/network_config.txt" file.
 * To enable the wireless automatically in ad-hoc mode, you must copy the content of "sys-files/interfaces" file to the /etc/network/interfaces, and make sure the networking and network-interfaces services are enabled on the specific run-level.

In order to enable 30dbm wireless tx power:
 * install wireless-regdb and crda - both shoud be installed by "sudo apt-get install wireless-regdb"
 * copy the sys-files/80-wireless-regdom.rules to the /etc/udev/rules.d/ folder - note that it relates to a specific device - you may want to change the vendor id to use other devices.

GPS:
 * Install kernel-module-pl2303 from opkg
 * Install gpsd libgps-dev
 * for gpsmon install gpsd-clients

Map:
 * Install libqgis-dev
 * Create the ~/.qgis directory (Qgis bug).


Video Transmisstion:
 * Install gstreamer0.10-tools and gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg 
 * Install gstreamer0.10-plugins-good
 * on Host, install vlc
 * device cmd: gst-launch-0.10 v4l2src ! video/x-raw-yuv,width=320,height=240,framerate=\(fraction\)5/1 ! ffmpegcolorspace ! jpegenc ! multipartmux ! udpsink host=? port=5000 &
 * on host - vlc: udp://@HOST_IP:5000

I2C:
 * In order for the i2c sensors to work, the modules rtc_ds1307 and rtc_twl must be put in the blacklist - they catch the 0x68 address.
 * To make the permissions of the device file good, you must copy the "sys-files/99*" file to the /etc/udev/rules.d

NetStick:
 * install network-manaer
 * ssh -X the device
 * run nm-connection-editor and add the 3G network
 * run nmctl con list
 * find the 3G uuid and run "nmctl con up uuid <uuid>"

To create a fresh start
 * adduser digi
 * apt-get update
 * install man subversion vim build-essential cmake libgtest-dev libarmadillo-dev libarmadillo2 libboost-all-dev iw wireless-regdb gpsd libgps-dev gpsd-clients liblas-dev liblapack-dev locate chkconfig
 * configure ccache by making links (man ccache)
