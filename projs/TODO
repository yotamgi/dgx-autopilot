 - Refactor the autopilot dir-tree.

 - Add the plane_hw interface and the cockpit interface to the autopilot.

 - Add some noise to the sensors in the simulator

 - Improve the stream watch to show more than one thing.

 - Move from the simulator all the stream-filtering (integral and stuff) to a proper autopilot program.

 - Move all the autopilot-sepcific filters (AccCompass, Gyro) to be in the autopilot other than libdata_stream

 - Add Reciever to the libdata_stream for the servo

 - Change both in the plane and in the AccCompass to use the RevievedStream.


OPTIMIZATIONS:
 - The time_delta is multiplied with the whole matrix in IntegralFilter<mtrix_t> - that's not fast. 
 - Make the Platform inline - this will lead to less virtual calls (the sensor generators).
