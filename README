 * install kernel-module-cdc-acm

Wireless:
 * install the rt3070 and rt3070-firmeare from opkg
 * To configure the ad-hoc thing use the "sys-files/network_config.txt" file.
 * To enable the wireless automatically in ad-hoc mode, you must copy the content of "sys-files/interfaces" file to the /etc/network/interfaces, and make sure the networking and network-interfaces services are enabled on the specific run-level.

 * on host - vlc: udp://@HOST_IP:5000

I2C:
 * In order for the i2c sensors to work, the modules rtc_ds1307 and rtc_twl must be put in the blacklist - they catch the 0x68 address.
